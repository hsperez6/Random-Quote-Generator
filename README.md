# Tech-Degree-Project-1--Random-Quote-Generator
Random Quote Generator

quotes array
In this project, I first created an array of objects and saved it to a variable called quotes. 
Each object contains several properties, including quote, source, citation, year, and tag.

getRandomQuote function
Secondly, I created a function called getRandomQuote() to randomly select one of the objects within
the quotes array. The getRandomQuote() function first generates a random index by multiplying
a random number between 0 and 1 (Math.random()) and multiplying it by length of the quotes array.
Next, I converted the result into an integer using Math.floor() and saved it to a variable ranInd. 
Finally, I instructed function to return object located in the ranInd index. 

printQuote function
Thirdly, I created a printQuote() function to generate a string using the quote selected by the
getRandomQuote() function. To do so, I first saved the quote object selected by the getRandomQuote()
function into a variable ranQuote. Second, I began a string using string interpolation, with <p> 
tags including a class attribute, and stored this initial string into a new variable stringTemp,
intentionally leaving out the closing </p> tag. Third, 

I used a conditional statement to check if a citation property exists within the quote object 
stored in ranQuote. If a citation property exists, an additional string (using string interpolation
and nested between <span> tags with class attribute "citation") with the value in the citation
property is concatenated to the string stored in the stringTemp variable.

I repeated this last step two more times, using a conditional statement to check whether year and tag
properties exist in the quote object stored in the ranQuote variable. If the properties exist,
additional strings were concatenated to the string stored in the stringTemp variable. If a string 
containing the year property was added, the string was nested between <span> tags including a class "year".
If the properties were not present, no additional strings were added. 

Next, the closing </p> tag is concatenated to the string in stringTemp. Lastly, I inserted the string in 
the stringTemp variable into the element labeled `quote-box` using .getElementById().innerHTML and 
closed the printQuote() function.

Next, I called the printQuote() function. 

The last line in this script prints the string generated by the previous functions onto the screen
by using .addEventListener()
